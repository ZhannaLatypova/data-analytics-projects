This repository is dedicated to Yandex Practicum‚Äôs Data Analyst (DAYP). It contains all major projects, completed in the program. Please feel free to take a look at the program syllabus and scroll through  <a href="https://practicum.yandex.ru">official website</a> , in meanwhile, I invite you to take a look at the projects, my certificate of completion, and highlights from the program.

## Program Highlights

DAYP program equipt me well with essential knowledge of data analysis. The lessons, case studies, and projects covered all aspects of data analysis:

‚óè Defining problem and analytical questions \
‚óè Data wrangling (gathering, assessing, and cleaning data) \
‚óè EDA and feature engineering \
‚óè Testing and concluding from descriptive & inferential statistics \
‚óè Data visualization and communication 

Additionally, I enjoyed the emphasis on Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matpolotlib, Ploty and Seaborn. I was most impressed with the statistical topics such as Binominal Distribution, Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, and A/B testing. The lesson also covered VIFs (variance inflation factors), full rank models and higher-order interactions in regression models. Essential knowledge for a deep understanding of data analysis and data science! I also loved the complex approach to the bivariate and multivariate visualizations with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Projects

Please find the summaries for each of the main projects that I have completed in the (DAYP) Program in the section below. Each individual summary contains project highlights and links to the project‚Äôs repository and submission review.

### üü£ Project 1 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Analyze%20A_B%20Test%20Results">Analyze A/B Test Results</a>    
In this project, I am performing A/B testing for the company‚Äôs new website. I performed hypothesis testing with Python and NumPy to determine p-value and used regression models to advise if the company should launch a new website. The result is robust statistical analysis and interpretation of results to ensure the right decision for the company. The highlights of this project are interpretations of p-value, z-score and critical value, use of full rank models, VIF and higher-order interactions in regression models.

### üü£ Project 2 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Business%20metrics%20of%20Ad%20campaigns">Business metrics of Ad campaigns</a>
Data analysis from Procrastinate PRO+ was carried out. Various metrics were calculated, cohort analysis was used: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc. Previously written metric calculation functions were used. Correct conclusions have been drawn based on the data obtained.\
Skills and tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, cohort analysis, unit economics, product metrics, Seaborn.

### üü£ Project 3 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Product%20analysis">Product analysis</a>
Optimization of the product range of the online store. Description: building a model to identify an "unnecessary" product range based on conducting EDA (research analysis) and testing statistical hypotheses. Technologies: Scipy, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tableau, MS PowerPoint.

### üü£ Project 4 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/SQL">SQL</a>

### üü£ Project 5 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Catering%20Market%20Research">Catering market research</a>
I have investigated the question of whether the cafe from the TV series "Friends" will be successful and popular for a long time. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation has been prepared for investors with recommendations. I used seaborn and plotly libraries in plotting.

### üü£ Project 6 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Explore%20Real%20estate%20market">Explore Real estate market</a>
Based on the data of the Yandex Real Estate service, the market value of various types of real estate objects, typical parameters of apartments, depending on the distance from the center, is determined. Data preprocessing has been carried out. New data has been added. Histograms, boxplots, and scatter diagrams are constructed.\
Skills and tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization and data preprocessing.\
Fields of activity: Internet services, ad platforms.

### üü£ Project 7 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Business%20decision-making_AB_testing">Business decision-making_A/B test</a>
The prioritization of hypotheses on the ICE and RICE frameworks has been carried out. Then I analyzed the results of the A/B test, plotted cumulative revenue, average receipt,
conversions by groups, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average receipts from raw and purified data. Based on the analysis, I made a decision about the inexpediency of further testing.\
Skills and tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A/B testing, statistical hypothesis testing.\
Fields of activity: Online stores.

### üü£ Project 8 -  <a href=". ">User behavior analysis</a>
In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, researched the users' path to purchase. Analyzed
the results of the A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.\
Skills and tools: A/B testing, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Event analytics, Product metrics, Plotly, statistical hypothesis testing, data visualization.\
Fields of activity: Startups, Business, Internet services.

### üü£ Project 9 -  <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Data%20Mining_games">Data Mining_games</a>
