This repository is dedicated to Yandex Practicum‚Äôs Data Analyst (DAYP). It contains all major projects, completed in the program. Please feel free to take a look at the program syllabus and scroll through  ![official website](https://practicum.yandex.ru), in meanwhile, I invite you to take a look at the projects, my certificate of completion, and highlights from the program.

## Data Analyst Certificate




## Program Highlights
_______
DAYP program equipt me well with essential knowledge of data analysis. The lessons, case studies, and projects covered all aspects of data analysis:

‚óè Defining problem and analytical questions \
‚óè Data wrangling (gathering, assessing, and cleaning data) \
‚óè EDA and feature engineering \
‚óè Testing and concluding from descriptive & inferential statistics \
‚óè Data visualization and communication 

Additionally, I enjoyed the emphasis on Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matpolotlib, Ploty and Seaborn. I was most impressed with the statistical topics such as Binominal Distribution, Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, and A/B testing. The lesson also covered VIFs (variance inflation factors), full rank models and higher-order interactions in regression models. Essential knowledge for a deep understanding of data analysis and data science! I also loved the complex approach to the bivariate and multivariate visualizations with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


## Projects
_______
Please find the summaries for each of the main projects that I have completed in the (DAYP) Program in the section below. Each individual summary contains project highlights and links to the project‚Äôs repository and submission review.

### üü£ Project 1- Analyze A/B Test Results
In this project, I am performing A/B testing for the company‚Äôs new website. I performed hypothesis testing with Python and NumPy to determine p-value and used regression models to advise if the company should launch a new website. The result is robust statistical analysis and interpretation of results to ensure the right decision for the company. The highlights of this project are interpretations of p-value, z-score and critical value, use of full rank models, VIF and higher-order interactions in regression models.
